# Furina Betting Games
A project that aims to simply recreate 2 betting games, played through the console, preferably in 1 file, and in as many programming languages as possible.
The goal is to have a vague understanding of each language's syntax and properties, as well as some experience scripting in all of them.
Most of these code were tested and ran using online compliers because I don't have that much space on my laptop for 50 languages. Sorry.

# This project has been written in 6 languages.
In chronological order, they are: C++, Python, C#, C, Haskell, Javascript

My experience/things I've learned with each language:
To be updated

# Upcoming language
Rust
