# Furina Betting Games
- A project that aims to simply recreate 2 simple betting games, played through the command line, preferably in 1 file, and in as many programming languages as possible.
- The goal is to have a vague understanding of each language's syntax and properties, as well as some experience scripting in all of them.
- Most of these code were tested and ran using online compliers because I don't have that much space on my laptop for 50 languages. Sorry.

# Next language: Rust

# This project has been written in 6 languages
In chronological order, they are: C++, Python, C#, C, Haskell, Javascript

My experience/things I've learned with each language:
1. C++: I started this project with C++ because it was the language being taught in my first year of university, and I got inspired after a friend of mine made a little gambling game in C and showed it to me. I was (and am still) passionate about Furina, and so I made a little CLI game. I thought about porting the game to different languages, as a challenge, out of curiosity of their various differences, and for fun.
2. Python
3. C#
4. C
5. Haskell: An absolute nightmare to get working. It did teach me quite a bit amount immutability and some functional programming paradigms.
6. Javascript
